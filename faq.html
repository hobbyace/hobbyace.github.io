        <div class="row">
            <p>The Crazepony MINI Quadcopter can of course be flown just because itâ€™s fun, but the main usage is as a development, teaching or experimentation platform. </p>
        </div>

        <h2><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>Is this quadcopter ready to fly?</h2>
        <div class="row">

        <h2><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>how to hook up the power antenna and SMA to extend RF to 100m?</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p>This kind of nRF24L01 SMA Antenna Wireless Transceiver is available for Crazepony RC on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OIQ8FS6" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.No new firmware is needed.Just plug out the old one and replace the tranceiver with PA.</p>

        <h2><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>Crazepony propeller got damaged and what replacements are available?</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p>The original propellers of Crazepony MINI quadcopter is 75mm nylon propeller.This is not available on e-platform like Amazon or Ebay.So I advice you to use the propeller of Parrot Minidrone Rolling Spider instead.The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R2PA0OM" target="_blank">propellers</a> of Parrot Rolling Spider are 66mm and work well on Crazepony.You could just replace all the props with Rolling Spider props and no upgrade firmware needed.</p>
